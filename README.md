# MachineLearning

Since I am particularly fascinated by machine learning when working with data, I have gained an overview of various algorithms in this project. To do this, I partially implemented them myself, as well as using the sklearn library that it provides for Python. I then looked for interesting data sets, mostly via kaggle.com, to see to what extent ML-ALgorithms could be used to draw insightful conclusions from this data. For the application, I then used both my self-programmed implementations and sklearn and compared them.

Start and basis for this project is the Codecademy course about Machine Learning
